<h3>How I usually love to celebrate my birthday:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Feeling special & appreciated – heartfelt wishes, attention, love, and being remembered matter more than big plans.</li>
  <li>Celebrating with close people – friends, family, or a small circle rather than a huge crowd.</li>
  <li>Creating memories – dressing up, clicking photos, cake-cutting, music, and moments they can remember later.</li>
</ul>
