<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a Computer Science and Engineering student with a strong interest in technology, problem-solving, and continuous learning. I enjoy understanding how things work and applying my knowledge to build practical solutions. I am driven by curiosity, adaptable to new challenges, and motivated to grow both technically and personally in a fast-evolving tech environment</p>
<p>Through my academic journey, I have gained hands-on experience in programming, web development, and machine learning. I have worked on projects such as crop mapping using machine learning to predict suitable crops based on soil and climate data, and smart spectacles for hidden camera detection to enhance personal privacy using RF signal analysis. These projects helped me strengthen my analytical thinking, teamwork, and real-world problem-solving skills.</p>
<p>I am skilled in languages like C, C++, Python, and have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, databases, and development tools such as Git and VS Code. Along with technical skills, I value communication and collaboration while working in teams. I am eager to contribute my skills, learn from industry exposure, and be part of innovative organizations that focus on impactful and meaningful solutions.</p>
